# Dividend-Discount-Model-python

 Script that calculates price of a stock
 
# using the dividend discount model

Created a function that calculates the price

Lets tackle this in two steps

# Step 1: Create the code for a single stock

# Step 2: Modify the code and turn it into a function

# This code only works for constant-growth stocks that pay a dividend

Using function, i looped through and calculate price of multiple tickers
